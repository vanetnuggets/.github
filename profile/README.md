# VANETlab
VANETlab is a team project that aims to provide a tool for visualizing nodes from the SUMO simulator, enhancing them with NS-3 functionality, and conducting simulations using NS-3 while displaying the simulation outputs.

## About 
VANETlab is a collaborative project developed by a team to facilitate research and experimentation in the field of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). It combines the capabilities of the SUMO traffic simulator and the NS-3 network simulator to create a comprehensive framework for VANET simulation and analysis.
